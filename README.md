# A-bot-Retired
A bot is the oldest bot we've had running and we're retiring it 

A bot was originally created for SCP Site Feevet and ran longer than our other bot for the server that died out after a few months. We're migrating A Bot from A Bot to the new name of the bot (undecided)

We have decided to release A bot into the public domain. We no longer have ownership of the bot and know and respect anyones descisions on what to do with the code, goodbye A bot We will miss you
